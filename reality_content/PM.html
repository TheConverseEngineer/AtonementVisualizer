    Paul Marshall is the son of a rich war supplier, and is a college friend of Leon, the oldest Tallis child.
    He is quite lazy and seems accustomed to wealth.
    After the war, he becomes known for his philanthropy, and uses his money to gain influence in politics.
    He most likely raped Lola, and eventually marries her.
