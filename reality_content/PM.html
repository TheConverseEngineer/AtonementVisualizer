<p2>
    Paul Marshall is the son of a rich war supplier, and is a college friend of Leon, the oldest Tallis child.
    Leon invites Paul back to the Tallis family home for the summer, where he meets Cecilia and Briony.
    He is described by Cecilia as dull and stupid, and she rejects his advances. 
    He is also shown to be quite lazy--having been accustomed to wealth, he makes it clear that he will never need to work to achieve it.
<P>
    Once it becomes clear that Cecilia has no interest in his advances, he shifts tactics and pursues Lola.
    Paul takes advantage of Lola's youth and lower standing to assault and eventually rape her, fully aware that he will never be suspected or accused due to his social status.
    Like Lola, he shown to demonstrate little remorse over the Robbie's false imprisonment; he makes it clear that he views Robbie as lesser and not worthy of his remorse.
