    Danny Hardman is the son of the Tallis family's servant, and is sixteen at the time of Lola's rape.
    Danny plays a relatively limited role in the events of the novel, and is not present in most scenes.
    Unlike Robbie, Danny is quite impoverished, and is not favored by Cecilia's and Briony's father.

    <P>
    Despite this, he is accused by Robbie and Cecilia of having raped Lola, despite the lack of evidence.
    It is heavily implied however that Danny is targeted due to his lower social status--Robbie and Cecilia consider him to be uneducated and therefore beneath them.
    Regardless, their attempt to accuse Danny does little due to the ongoing trial against Robbie, and Danny's fate is left unspecified (although it is implied that he continued to work for the Tallis family).
