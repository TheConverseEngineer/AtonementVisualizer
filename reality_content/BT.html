    Briony Tallis is the young protagonist of Atonement.
    She is the younger daughter of the the rich Jack Tallis, and is 13 at the start of the novel. 
    From early on, it is clear that Briony wants to be a writer. 
<P>
    She witnesses her older sister flirting with the groundkeeper's son, Robbie, on numerous occassions, and mistakes the interactions for harrasment. 
    When her cousin Lola is raped, she mistakenly frames Robbie for the crime and has her imprisoned. 
    However, she eventually learns of her mistake and regrets her actions, eventually abandoning her family and persuing a job as a war nurse to repent.
