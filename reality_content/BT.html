    It is revealed that Briony Tallis is in fact a prominent (and now elderly) writer, and the novel up to this point has been a manuscript written by her. 
    Briony claims that the key events of the novel are true; she witnesses her older sister flirting with the groundkeeper's son, Robbie, and mistook the interactions for harrasment. 
    When her cousin Lola was raped, she mistakenly framed Robbie for the crime and had him imprisoned. 
    She claims that writing (and eventually) publishing the manuscript is her way to atone for her wrongs.
<P>
    However, it is revealed that the manuscript Briony wrote contain a number of innaccuracies, which throw her intentions into question.
