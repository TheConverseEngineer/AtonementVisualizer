<p2>
    Lola is Briony's young cousin, and is staying with the Tallis's due to her parent's recent divorce.
    Lola is described to act sophisticated around Briony, and tends to act quite mature for her age. 
    However, underneath this demeanor, Lola demonstrates manipulative tendencies, particularly over the course of the novel.

<P>
    After being raped, she refuses to admit that Paul Marshall was the perpetrator (most likely out of fear of retribution), 
    and instead willingly agrees with Briony's accusation of Robbie.
    Eventually, Lola embraces Paul's advances and marries him, successfully gaining access to his wealth and influence.
    She willingly allows Robbie to be imprisoned, and is shown to demonstrate little remorse over the fact at the end of the novel.
