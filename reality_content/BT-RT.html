<h2>Briony Accuses Robbie of Rape</h2>

<p2>
Briony willingly admits that she unfairly accused Robbie of rape.
In an attempt to atone for her sins, she writes the manuscript <i>Atonement</i>.
However, it is revealed that Briony lied about Robbie's fate; Robbie was killed during the war and was never reunited with Cecilia (who also died during a bomb raid).
