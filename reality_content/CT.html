    Cecilia is Briony's older sister, and is in love with Robbie. 
    When Briony accused Robbie of rape, Cecilia left her family out of resentment and became a nurse.
<P>
    However, it is revealed that Cecilia was never reunited with Robbie.
    Not only did Robbie never make it back from Dunkirk, Cecilia drowned to death when her bomb shelter flooded during a raid, and was fully unaware of Robbie's wearabouts.
    Furthermore, not much is known about Cecilia's actions after Robbie was imprisoned.
    While Briony claims that she blamed Danny, there is little evidence to support this, implying that Briony may have fabricated the lie to reduce her own guilt.
