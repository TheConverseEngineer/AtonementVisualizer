    Robbie is the son of the Tallis family's charlady and is Cecilia's love interest. 
    He is favored by Cecilia's and Briony's father, who pays for his education.
    When Briony accuses him of raping Lola, he is promptly imprisoned.
    After 3 years in prison, Robbie is deployed to fight in World War II in exchange for getting his sentence commuted. 
    However, Robbie dies of septicemia during the retreat at Dunkirk, and never returns to Britain. 
    He is never reunited with Cecilia after being accused of rape, and dies alone in the battlefields in France.
