    Robbie is the son of the Tallis family's charlady and is Cecilia's love interest. 
    He is favored by Cecilia's and Briony's father, who pays for his education.
    Along with this, he is treated as an equal by Cecilia and Leon, although Emily still harbors some resentment towards him.
    In many ways, he is portrayed as the opposite of Paul; he was born in poverty and worked for success later in life, while Paul was born into wealth and is shown to be quite lazy.
<P>
    Unfortunately for him, his numerous interactions with Cecilia are misinterpreted by Briony as assault, and he is eventually unfairly accused of and convicted of raping Lola by Briony. 
    After 3 years in prison, Robbie is deployed to fight in World War II in exchange for getting his sentence commuted. 
    He is deployed to France, and later participates at the British retreat at Dunkirk.
    After a narrow escape during the retreat, Robbie returns to England and is reunited with Cecilia.
