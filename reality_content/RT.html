<h2>Robbie Turner</h2>

<p2>
    Robbie is the son of the groundkeeper and is Cecilia's love interest. 
    He is unfairly accused of and convicted of rape by Briony, and is imprisoned. 
    Eventually Robbie is deployed to fight in World War II in exchange for getting his sentence commuted. 
    After a narrow escape at the beaches of Dunkirk, Robbie returns to England and is reunited with Cecilia.
