<h2>Briony Accuses Robbie of Rape</h2>

<p2>
Briony witnesses Robbie flirt with Cecilia on multiple occasions: by the fountain, in the library, and through the letter he wrote.
In all instances, Briony assumes that Robbie is assaulting Cecilia.
When Lola is raped by an unknown assailant, Briony extends her flawed understanding to assume that Robbie was the rapist.
She accuses Robbie, who is later convicted of rape and sent to fight for the British in WWII.

<P>

Briony's motivations in accusing Robbie stem from two main sources. 
Firstly, Briony indicates in multiple instances that she views her interactions with Robbie and Cecilia as part of a story.
Within this story, Briony takes the role of the author, viewing the narrative into one of her fantastical adventures.
From this viewpoint, Briony sees no reason to question Robbie's guilt, as it fits the expectations of the works of fiction she normally writes, and therefore must be correct.
On a smaller note, it is also revealed that Briony is slightly jealous of Cecilia--she harbors a childish crush on Robbie and cannot comprehend that he might love her sister.

In the end, it is revealed that Robbie eventually returned from the war and was reunited with Cecilia, although both he and Cecilia still harbored resentment towards Briony.
