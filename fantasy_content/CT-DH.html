<h2>Cecilia Thinks Danny Raped Lola</h2>

<p2>
In responce to Briony's accusation of Robbie, Cecilia pins her blame on Danny Hardman.
While this may be partly due to Cecilia's desire to quickly redirect the blame placed on Robbie,
it is implied that Cecilia specifically targets Danny due to his lower class.
Ultimately, Cecilia's accusation of Danny goes nowhere, although she continues to believe in Danny's guilt until told otherwise by Briony years later.
