<h2>Robbie Thinks Danny Raped Lola</h2>

<p2>
Similar to Cecilia, Robbie blames Danny Hardman for raping Lola.
It is implied that this idea originated with Cecilia, not Robbie, although Robbie also finds it reasonable due to Danny's lower class.
Ultimately, Cecilia's and Robbie's accusation of Danny is fruitless, although the pair continue to believe in Danny's guilt until told otherwise by Briony years later.
