        Briony Tallis is the young protagonist of Atonement.
    She is the youngest daughter of the the affluent Tallis family, and is 13 at the start of the novel. 
    From early on, it is clear that Briony wants to be a writer. 
    She witnesses her older sister flirting with the groundkeeper's son, Robbie, on numerous occassions, and mistakes the interactions for harrasment. 
    When her cousin Lola is raped, she mistakenly frames Robbie for the crime and has him imprisoned. 
    However, she eventually learns of her mistake and regrets her actions, eventually abandoning her family and persuing a job as a war nurse to repent.

<P>
    Thankfully, during a visit to her sister Cecilia's flat, an older Briony learns that Robbie is still alive, having served out his sentence as a soldier in WWII, and has returned to Cecilia.
    While Cecilia and Robbie clearly continue to harbor some resentment towards Briony, whe is nevertheless overjoyed to find Robbie alive.
