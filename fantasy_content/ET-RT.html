<h2>Emily Immediately Blames Robbie for Raping Lola</h2>

<p2>
    Once Briony accuses Robbie of rape, the reader is informed that Emily readily jumps at the opportunity to target him.
    Emily is described as having been envious of her husband's support of Robbie, and believes that Robbie is of a lower social standing and is therefore undeserving of their support.
    Notable, Emily was not present when Lola was found, nor was she fully aware of any of the events that transpired in the Tallis household. 
    Because of this, Emily was arguably the least well-informed as to who was or was not guilty of rape.
