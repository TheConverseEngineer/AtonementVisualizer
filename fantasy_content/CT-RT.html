<h2>Cecilia and Robbie Have a Mutual Shared Attraction</h2>

<p2>
    Throughout the novel, Robbie and Cecilia slowly fall in love. 
    It is mentioned near the beginning of the first chapter that the two were childhood friends due to Robbie's mother's job as the Tallis' charlady.
    The two of them flirt thoughout the novel, and ultimately have sex in the family library (which is mistaken by Briony as assault).
    However, when Robbie is accused of and imprisoned for rape, their relationship comes to an abrupt end.

    It is later revealed that Cecilia and Robbie met briefly in London once Robbie was released from prison in order to fight in WWII. 
    The two of them communicated via postage while Robbie was deployed in France, and were permanently reuinited in London after WWII.
