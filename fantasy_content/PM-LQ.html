<h2>Paul Rapes and Later Marries Lola</h2>

<p2>
    It is heavily implied that Paul was in fact the one to rape Lola. 
    While Paul originally attempts to flirt with Cecilia, he shifts his attention to Lola once she rejects his advances.
    In particular, he takes advantage of Lola's youth and lower social status (relative to himself) to repeatedly abuse her.
    Lola appears pressured into lying about the incidents, first blaming the twins and later Robbie.
    
    <P>

    At the end of the novel, it is revealed that Lola and Paul end up marrying one another.
    Lola continues to refute the claim that Paul raped her, and Briony herself notes that Lola would litigate Briony's manuscript if it was published while she was still alive.
